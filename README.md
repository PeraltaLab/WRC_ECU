For information regarding the project, please visit: Goodwillie, C., M. W. McCoy, and A. L. Peralta. 2020. Long-term nutrient enrichment, mowing, and ditch drainage interact in the dynamics of a wetland plant community. Ecosphere 11(10):e03252. https://doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.3252

## We address the following questions

* **Aim 1.)**: How does long-term fertilization and disturbance (by mowing) influence wetland plant diversity?

* **Aim 2.)**: How does long-term fertilization and disturbance (by mowing) influence wetland obligate plant species? 

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:**: An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Mike McCoy, Mario Muscarella, and Ariane Peralta containing functions used in analysis of plant species data.

* **data:**: Files associated with soil and plant data sets. 

* **figures:**: Figures (of plant community composition) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.
